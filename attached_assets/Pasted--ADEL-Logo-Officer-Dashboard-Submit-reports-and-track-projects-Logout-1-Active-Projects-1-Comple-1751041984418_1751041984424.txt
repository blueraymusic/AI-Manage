Reagan - Project 1
The presidency of Ronald Reagan (1981–1989) marked a dramatic shift in U.S. environmental policy, characterized by aggressive deregulation, budget cuts, and a pro-industry agenda that critics argue sacrificed ecosystems for economic gain. Under Reagan, key environmental protections were weakened, leading to accelerated habitat destruction, toxic waste crises, and long-term ecological damage. This report examines the controversial policies and scandals that defined Reagan’s environmental legacy, including their consequences and lasting effects.
