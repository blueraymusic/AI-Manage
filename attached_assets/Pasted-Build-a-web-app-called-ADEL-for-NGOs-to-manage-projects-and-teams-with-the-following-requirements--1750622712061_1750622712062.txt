İdea:  Be very Careful!
admin create an account with their organization name and gets a specific number when officer create an account he would be required to type in that number or code so as for hşs session to belong to his org, now inside the session, the admin can set budgets and everything, the officer only can upload reports, and when they upload the admin would have to approve it in order for the progress to be recorded, and when recorded it would go in the data which either the admin or officer could use to generate progression charts. the admin can invite officers through links and so on. When the officer uploads, the admin has to be able to see it and also preview or even download the report file he uploaded, upon approval, the the admin can estimate the progress amount and enter it so as to move progress bar towards the goal.
The app landing page has to be very good looking, ill provide you with a logo picture every button has to work.
